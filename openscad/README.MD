The is a remix of the ["zapta" Arduino Motorized SMT Solder Paste Dispenser](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1119914) , with the following mods:

- add holes for solder-side pins of the stepper controller board.
- convert 28BYJ-48 stepper motor from [unipolar to bipolar](http://www.jangeox.be/2013/10/change-unipolar-28byj-48-to-bipolar.html) for more torque
- use an [aluminum 4mm to 5mm shaft coupler](https://www.google.com/search?&q=%2B%22D19*L25%22+Shaft+Coupling+Aluminium+flexible+%2B%224x5%22+aliexpress) instead of a 3D-printed shaft coupler

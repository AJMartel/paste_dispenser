The is a remix of the ["zapta" Arduino Motorized SMT Solder Paste Dispenser](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1119914) , with two mods:

- [stepper controller board with footswitch and oled](https://github.com/koendv/paste_dispenser)
- an [aluminum 4mm to 5mm shaft coupler](https://www.google.com/search?&q=%2B%22D19*L25%22+Shaft+Coupling+Aluminium+flexible+%2B%224x5%22+aliexpress) instead of a 3D-printed one
